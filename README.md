# CareerBearRestAPI

Restful api for career bear application

To expand the scope of my team's cisc275 project career bear (https://github.com/JamiePacheco/Cisc275_Project) I have taken the liberty of 
making a backend spring boot application to faciliate the managment of user data

Largely leveraging spring data jpa, CRUD operations are implemented to control user data, user credentials, etc.

For the actual running instance, this repo pipelines into a heroku application with a postgreSQL database instance
